## Simple Summary

This AIP when implemented will onboard Kelp DAO's rsETH Liquid Re-staking Token (LRT) onto the Aave v3 Ethereum deployment as collateral.

## Motivation

[KelpDAO](https://www.kelpdao.xyz/restake/) is one of the largest liquid restaking protocol built on top of the Eigen Layer. Restakers on Kelp get access to multiple benefits like re-staking rewards, staking rewards and DeFi yields.

KelpDAO has undergone multiple security audits by top tier audit firms including Sigma Prime and Code4rena. More about KelpDAOâ€™s security here: [Kelp DAO Audit reports](https://kelp.gitbook.io/kelp/audits)

The motivation for this proposal is to offer users a diverse range of LRTs as collateral on the Aave Protocol.
