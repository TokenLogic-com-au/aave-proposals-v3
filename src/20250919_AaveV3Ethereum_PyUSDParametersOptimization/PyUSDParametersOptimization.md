## Simple Summary

This proposal updates the pyUSD reserve configuration on Ethereum v3 Core.

## Motivation

This publication proposes aligning the Reserver Factor and Uoptimal for the pyUSD Reserve with various other stables ahead of a potential incentive campaign from PayPal.

The key changes include:

- Adjusting pyUSD Reserve Factor (RF) from 20% to 10%: With <$15M in liquidity within the Reserve, decreasing the RF routes a larger portion of the interest paid by users who borrow pyUSD to users who deposit pyUSD.
- Adjusting Optimal Utilization (Uoptimal) from 80% to 90%: We recommend to increasing the Uoptimal of pyUSD, to better reflect the borrow and supply dynamism for these assets.
- Reducing Slope 1 from 10.5% to 6.5%: Aligns pyUSDâ€™s interest rate curve with other stablecoins in Aave v3 Ethereum, moderating borrow costs up to the kink and improving competitiveness.
- Setting Loan-to-Value (LTV) from 75% to 0%: Disables pyUSD as collateral to minimize oracle-related risks and reduce incentive-driven looping, ensuring healthier market growth.

## Specification

The following pyUSD Reserve parameters are to be updated:

| Parameters     | Current Value | Updated Value |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Asset          | PYUSD         | PYUSD         |
| UOptimal       | 80%           | 90%           |
| Reserve Factor | 20%           | 10%           |
| Slope 1        | 10.5%         | 6.5%          |
| LTV            | 75%           | 0%            |
