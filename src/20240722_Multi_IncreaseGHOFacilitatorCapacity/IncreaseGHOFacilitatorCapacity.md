## Simple Summary

This publication proposes increasing the CCIP Facilitator Capacity on Arbitrum from 1M units to 5M units via the Direct-to-AIP process.

## Motivation

GHO was successfully launched on Arbitrum and the CCIP GHO Facilitator Bucket Capacity is 100% utilized. With $3.41M of liquidity and a solid peg during launch, there is sufficient depth to facilitate increasing the CCIP GHO Facilitator Bucket Capacity from 1M to 5M in line with the initial risk parameters proposed prior to launch.

## Specification

This proposal will increase the CCIP GHO Facilitator Bucket Capacity from 1M units to 5M units via the Direct-to-AIP process.
The equivalent bridgeLimit is also being increased on Ethereum Mainnet to 5M units.
