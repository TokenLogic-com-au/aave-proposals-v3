## Simple Summary

This publication presents the Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC) Phase IV request.

## Motivation

In the near future we expect GHO to be listed on InstadApp with several curated vaults providing additional utility and yield opportunites that use GHO.

A sUSDS/GHO strategy vault is expected to launch on Contango with support from the Contango team. Early stage discussions with prospective investors is promising.

We also expect GHO to feature in the upcoming Royco launch with the intent to drive flows into several yield strategies across Ethereum and Arbitrum.

Achieving 50M of DEX liquidity on Ethereum across various integrations remains a key focus. Whilst we are yet to acheive this target, we are currently very well positioned for current market conditions.

## Specification

Create an Allowance for GHO on Ethereum for a total of 950,000 GHO.

ALC Ethereum SAFE: [`0xA1c93D2687f7014Aaf588c764E3Ce80aF016229b`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xA1c93D2687f7014Aaf588c764E3Ce80aF016229b)
