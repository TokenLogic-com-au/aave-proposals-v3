## Simple Summary

This publication presents the Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC) Phase V request.

## Motivation

The motivation for Phase V focuses on stabilizing GHO's peg and deepening liquidity to support large swaps with minimal price impact. Key efforts include deploying GHO on new networks like Base and Avalanche, promoting adoption through integrations with protocols like Synthetix and Fluid, and leveraging liquidity incentives like Royco Quests. These initiatives aim to enhance GHO's utility, expand its ecosystem, and maintain stability across chains, guided by measurable performance metrics.

## Specification

Swap the following assets to GHO and deposit into the Prime instance on Ethereum.

|     Ethereum     |
| :--------------: |
| aEthUSDT (1.25M) |
| aEthUSDC (1.25M) |

Create an Allowance allowing the ALC to withdraw GHO from the Prime instance for a total of 2,000,000 GHO.
